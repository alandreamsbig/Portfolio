CS430 HW2

The program takes command line arguments, reads in postscript files and pipe
it to an XPM file where it will display polygons.Sample files are given, with
out of boud points and in boud points. I've tested all of the sample files input and they seem
to all be working. The program was written in C++ and the file
containing main is hw3.cpp and executable file should be A3.

To run the program:
just type "make" and the Makefile will compile and create executable A3.
Then type ./A3 -f hw3_1.ps > out1.xpm
