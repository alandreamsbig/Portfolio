CS430 HW6

The features of the program includes reading in smf file and produces 3D
image in xpm file format. Most of the drawing outputs are correct but some
roundings may screw up a bit. The program was written in c++ 11. I wrote
everything on tux vim so everything should be fine. The file contains
readme, makefile and hw6.cpp.

To run the program:
just type "make" and the Makefile will compile and create executable A6.
