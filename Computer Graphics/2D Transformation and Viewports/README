CS430 HW5

The only thing that is not working fully is the viewport. You can somewhat
see the viewport window, but the filling of the polygons will go crazy.
Other than that, everthing else seems to be fine.

The program takes command line arguments, reads in postscript files and pipe
it to an XPM file where it will display polygons.Sample files are given, with
out of boud points and in boud points. I've tested all of the sample files input and they seem
to all be working. The program was written in C++ and the file
containing main is hw5.cpp and executable file should be A5.

To run the program:
just type "make" and the Makefile will compile and create executable A5.
Then type bash runtests.sh
