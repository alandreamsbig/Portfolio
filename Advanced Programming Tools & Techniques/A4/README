To whom it may concern:
There are some flaws with the delete album(-d) funtion, it is able to delete
the entire album only if the album is not the last one in sample.db.
Also, after adding a new album and deleting the album may not always work.
If you delete an album and try to do other commands, the program might not
run and you will have to use a "orginal" sample.db for other command
testing. I've tried my best, but the delete function only works in a certain
way.
