<h1> Assignment - Cat &amp; Mouse </h1>

<div>
<img src='island.png' alt='Island' align='left'/>
<p> Okay, we'll be playing a little game.  Imagine an island (okay, a 5x5
grid).  This island is surrounded by water, and there are 6 bridges off of
the island.  On the island is a hungry cat, and a scared mouse. </p>

<p> The cat is hungry, but it's his island, and he won't leave it.  The
mouse, of course, will escape, if he finds a bridge.  Sadly, in his fright,
he might run into the water and drown (had a terrible experience as a young
mouse, never learned to swim). </p>

<p> At the beginning of the game, both the cat and the mouse are placed
randomly on the island proper.

<p> The bridges are roughly evenly&ndash;spaced, 2 on each side. </p>
</div>

<p> 
<img src='grid.png' alt='Island as a grid' align='right'/>
I'd recommend extending the coordinate system to include the bridges and the
immediately surrounding water. </p>

<p> Create  an <code>Animal</code> abstract class.  It'll have a protected
attribute, of type <code>Point</code>, its location on the map, and a
private String attribute, the animal's name.  You'll need to add other
attributes, as well. </p>

<p> It'll define these methods: </p>

<ul>
	<li> <code>String getName()</code> </li>
	<li> <code>Point getLocation()</code> </li>
	<li> <code>void setStartLocation()</code> </li>
</ul>

<p> <code>Animal</code> will have a single constructor, that takes a
<code>String</code> (the animal's name), a <code>Random</code> object
(the single random number generator that everybody will use).  It'll store
these values as instance variables (attributes). </p>

<ul>
	<li> <code>Animal( String name, Random rng )</code></li>
</ul>

<p> It'll also declare an abstract method: </p>

<ul>
	<li> <code>void move()</code> </li>
</ul>

<p> Inherit from <code>Animal</code> to create a <code>Cat</code> class;
override the <code>move</code> method, to randomly move north, south, east
or west.  Again, the cat will not jump in the water, nor will it cross a
bridge.  It'll have a single constructor, that takes a String, calls the
parent class' constructor to set the name. </p>

<p> Also create a <code>Mouse</code> class from <code>Animal</code>; again,
override the <code>move</code> method, to randomly move north, south, east
or west.  If the mouse drowns or escapes he won't make any more moves.  You
might need to keep (and initialize) another attribute, to track the mouse's
mobility.  It also has a single constructor, to set the name. </p>

<p> Finally, create a <code>Chase</code> class, which'll have a static
<code>playGame</code> method, which plays a single game, and returns a
status (cat had a snack, mouse escaped, mouse drowned). </p>

<p> Randomly choose a starting point for each animal.  To be fair, if they
start on the same spot, pick another start for one of the animals.  The
mouse moves first; if he lands on a square that has a bridge he escapes, the
game is done.  If he falls in the water, the game is also done.  Then the
cat gets to move; if he lands on the same spot, he gets a snack, and play is
over. </p>

<p> In the <code>Chase</code> class, write a <code>main</code> method
which'll play the game 30 times, and report the outcome, to standard out, in
a single line. </p>

<p> You may add any (non-public) helper methods to any class that you find
useful. </p>

<h3> Picking random numbers </h3>

<p> You'll want to create a <code>Random</code> object, and use the
<code>nextInt( n )</code> method. </p>

<p> There will be only one generator for the entire program; create it
(once) in the main driver, and pass it to your animals as you create them.
</p>


<h3> Input </h3>

<p> None </p>

<h3> Output </h3>

<p> You are to print the result of each of 30 trials to stdout, one result
per line, single spaced.  After all the trials print a blank line, then
report 3 statistics:  The % of times the mouse escaped, drowned, and was
eaten. </p>
