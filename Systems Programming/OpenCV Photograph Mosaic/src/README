The purpose of this assignment is to use the OpenCV library and create a
photograph mosaic using simple color techniques. I will create a new image
by compositing smalller images together. 

To generate the image, use the command:
./hw3ex phil.jpg 128 96 thumbs/*

I had trouble compiling at first because I forgot a line which compute the
average color in getAvgColors() but after using the print statements to find
where the program ends and debugging, I was able to generate the mosaic
image. Everthing works
