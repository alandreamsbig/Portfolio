A way to tell that I did not cheat is to use git log and see what I have
changed for the labsheet. If I delete my answers and committed the labsheet,
you can do git checkout [mylabsheetanswersdeletionnumber] and see the
deleted labsheet. Also, I'm doing this right next to the TA Surgey,so I did
not cheat.
