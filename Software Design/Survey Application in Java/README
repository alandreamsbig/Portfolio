The program uses java serialization to save and load files, the files are
located in a folder called SurveyTest the same path as the current user
directory. The files are .ser extension. When loading a file, just type the
file name, no need to type the extension. MAKE SURE to SAVE the file
everytime you modify, take the survey/test so it can tabulate and grade.
Also you need to load the file first in order to take the survey/test.
