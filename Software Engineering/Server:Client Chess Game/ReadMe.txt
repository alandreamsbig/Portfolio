Space Checkers

We have provided the runnaable jar file for our project.
To run our game first you need to run the server  after the server you can run clients and play a game of checkers.

We have hardcoded the ip address and port in client side code. So to run a server on your machine you need to change IP address to your server machine. 
Currently its ip address of our laptop.

There are some issues and some know bugs. but overall you can play a game 
with 2 clients connected to server.
