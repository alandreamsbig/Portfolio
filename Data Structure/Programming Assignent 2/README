Programming assignment 2

The only problem I did not do was the timing and left most child
implementation. I included the list of children header file but had trouble
implementing it. 

NOTE: I used some of the online resources as a reference to work on, the
reference citations are in each of the file. The code were modified to fit
the need of this assignment.
