I started off the program by using a reference to create the hashtable and
linked list. The program computes the ASCII sum of each word in the way
mentioned on the assignment page, a = 1, b=2, c=3... The program creates a
hashtable and each bucket contains a linked list of words. If you run the
program, you can see my hashtable and the elements in each bucket. The
hashtable index is also the ASCII sum value which makes it easier to look
at. Words with the same ASCII sum value are put in to the same bucket. I had
trouble with pointing to an empty bucket which result a segfault but I fixed
it. However, I still have trouble with sorting the linked list and check if
they are anagram.
