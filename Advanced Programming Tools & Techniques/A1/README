Hi, Ken
Thanks for doing this and spending time helping me. Very appreciate it.

What I learned:

1.
When debugging a program, it is helpful to try single commands on the
command line first and see if it works then implement it to the program.

2.
Indenting in bash is critical, make sure the conditions statements are
correctly indented.

3.
The logic of recursion is to call the function itself multiple times until
it meets a condition that should not happen

4.
A way to parse strings from a file can be done by saving the strings to a
variable first then use the "cut -d" command to split the fields

5.
Checking if index and required string exist can be done by using the -n

6.
-d and -f checks if it is a directory or a file

7.
calling bash variables must add a "$" before the variable name

8.
The debugging technique is to fix one part of the program at a time, try to
think in the right direction, in other words, check if my logic is right or
wrong

9. 
find . -name dir.xml -printf "%p\n" -exec cat {} \; 
this is a useful command to see all the xml files at one time

10.
Add echo after or before certain area of conditional statements or loop to
see if the programs goes through the conditional statements or loop. Helpful
for debugging.
