Assignment G3

This is a threaded chat program which contians server and client. It also
generates keys, encrypt and decrypt the keys.

I am not sure how the server and client work for the Makefile. I've hard
coded the server name and port in the Makefile. My threaded chat works
completely, I have ran tests with my partner(Charly) on tux. To test the
program, open two tux windows, run the server and client on the same machine
and port, start typing and it should work. 

I have also implemented the miniRSA functions, finding the Nth prime and
creating the keys. Hoever, I had trouble doing the encrypt and decrypt so I
wasn't able to do the key cracker.

To run the program

Server
gcc csapp.c server.c -lpthread -o server
./server tux64-11.cs.drexel.edu 8080

client
gcc csapp client.c -lpthread -o client
./client 8080

miniRSA

gcc miniRSA.c -o miniRSA
./miniRSA ${nthprime} ${mthprime}
