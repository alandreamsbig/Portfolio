CS430 HW1

The program takes command line arguments, reads in postscript files and pipe
it to an XPM file where it will display images.There are some minor issues
with the program where if the line has infinite slope(a verticle line) it
does not draw. Also, some images only have serveral dots on the line whihch
makes it hard to read. The program was written in C++ and the file
containing main is hw1.cpp and executable file should be A1.

To run the program:

make arg='-f' ps='hw1_1.ps' xpm='out1.xpm'

(the ps and xpm can be replaced with whatever file you want)
