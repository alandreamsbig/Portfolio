1.1 
A segmentation fault occured and a file called core was modified. An
executable file called bug3 was also created.

1.2
It bombed the function #0  0x00002abe8a7a6090 in ?? ()

1.3
a. 
Does not compile. The n should be passed by reference in scanf

b.
Does not compile. Should switch the float and decimal for the output stream

c.
The while loop was itterating before the values were added to the array

d.
Does not compile. Change the n for the scanf function to passed by reference

e.
Does not compile. Missing braces for the for loop. last is not iterated
correctly. The program needs a ranomized pivot locatoin so the return array
does not have empty first element. We can assert a new pivot location

1.4
The compiler cannot catch this because it isn't a syntax error. It was a
logic error. However, we can see it in the stack because the values are the
same in the stack

1.5
There will be an error because the string comparison function can not see
the differnece of integer values. There is a type specific when we pass the
string comparison function to sort integers.
