CS430 HW7

The features of the program includes reading in smf file and produces 3D
image in xpm file format.The program can scanfill the 3D images with colors.
The program was written in c++ 11. I wrote
everything on tux vim so everything should be fine. The file contains
readme, makefile and hw7.cpp.

To run the program:
just type "make" and the Makefile will compile and create executable A7.
